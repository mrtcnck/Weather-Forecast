# Weather-Forecast
 
In this project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
For weather information, the user is first asked for location information. 
After the user allows the location, the weather forecast for the next 5 days is listed. 
The weather information comes via API and I do API Fetch with JavaScript. 
I send the incoming data into HTML with JavaScript, not manually.

<h2 align="left">How to use?</h2>
Open and allow the location.
